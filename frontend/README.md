# Hello! Welcome to my app's repository.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Run npm install on the frontend folder to install the React App and its dependencies, and after that run npm install on the root folder of this repo to install the other dependencies.

After that, on the root folder, open up a terminal and run npm run dev.

## How to use this app

This app allows you to search for products and check out additional information on them.
You can view a product's details either by passing the ID as a url param, or by simply clicking the link after searching for a product.
The same concept applies to searching products. You can search for products either using the searchbar, or passing the search value as a URL param.
