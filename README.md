This is a small application that allows users to search for items and check more information about them using the Mercado Libre API.


I wanted to make it really easy and intuitive for users to search for products, so I added the possibility of searching for items by simply passing
the search value in the URL. Same thing with the product detail. If you want, just pass the ID to the details URL.


To start this app, simply run 'npm run dev' on the root folder.
Hope you enjoy it!
